// A linked list is a data structure in which individual nodes are linked
// together by pointing to each other. Specifically, a singly-linked list is one
// where the first node links to the second node by including a reference to it.
//
// Each node consists of a value as well as a reference to the next node, which
// may be null to denote that there are no further nodes in the list and that
// this node is the last node in the list.
//
// Linked lists are useful compared to arrays (in traditional languages) because
// arrays are static, they can't grow to accommodate more values. Instead you're
// forced to allocate a new bigger array and then copy over the elements to the
// new array, then deallocate the old array.
//
// Comparatively, you can append to a linked list by simply allocating memory
// for a single node (which again consists only of the value and the reference),
// then you simply make the last node in the list point to this new node in
// order to include it in the list.
//
// You should see a linked list as a collection/sequence of values, just as you
// would see an array. The difference is in how the collection is implemented
// under the hood.
//
// In Javascript, you can simply array.push(value) and stuff, but this could
// incur the cost I outlined above, even if it's hidden from you.
//
// There are many optimizations and changes you can make to this current linked
// list implementation, but you can do them later.

// the end of the list.
